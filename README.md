### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Manuel (but you can call me Manu). I am a full stack web developer looking to become more experienced. I first learned the basics of programming at around 2019 with Python on a school course --mind you, after YEARS of telling myself that programming was the LAST thing I would do--, and a few years later decided to learn how to make websites and applications. I love learning! 

### Below you can see some repositories which display my skills, although I'm constantly updating and adding new ones (or upgrading the old ones) because I always feel like I can do even better. You may also take a look at them and give me your inputs on them!
